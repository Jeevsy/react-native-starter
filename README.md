## Summary

1. The application runs on **both iOS and Android** with a **single code** base
1. A User can **Register, Login, Logout, Reset their Password** and modify their **Profile**
1. The Forms display messages for **help and field validation**.
1. The Forms are **protected** when fetching.
1. The Forms display **spinner** when fetching.
1. Form submission **errors are displayed** (see above Login)
1. **All state changes*** are actions to the Redux store.
1. The backend is provided by either a Hapi server or Parse server using the **Rest API**
1. **Every action** performed by the UI interfaces with the **Redux actions** and subsequently to the Redux Store.  This **reduces the complexity** of the JSX Components **tremendously**and makes them easily testable.

## Editor Configuration

**Atom**

<img src="screenshots/atom_editor.png" width="600" height="270">

**Package:** Nuclide

**UI Theme:** One Dark

**Syntax Theme:** Gloom

**Additional Packages:**
```bash
apm install editorconfig es6-javascript javascript-snippets linter linter-eslint language-babel
```

## Notes

Code is written to [JS Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) and validated with [Eslint](http://eslint.org/).  To setup your favorite editor using the Eslint configuration, see [Editors](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors)

Navigation is handled with [React Native Router Flux](https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux).  Multiple scenes support **Login, Register, and Reset Password**.  Once successfully logged in, there are 3 more scenes: **Logout, Subview, and Profile**.

A user can **change** their **Email Address** and **User Name** once they are logged in using the **Profile** form.

The icons used throughout the app are from [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons), namely using **FontAwesome**

**Form building** is extremely easy and consistent by using [Tcomb Form Library](https://github.com/gcanti/tcomb-form-native) by using **domain models** and writing less code.

Using [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), the state of the application is **testable** with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), which includes [Snapshot tests](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html) currently with 85 tests and ~90% coverage!!!  

Using the [Validate.JS](https://validatejs.org/) Library, all **user input is validated**.  Appropriate messages are displayed to the user guiding them in the input requirements.

Once a user is logged in, their **Session State is stored** in [AsyncStorage](https://github.com/jasonmerino/react-native-simple-store) so that subsequent usage does not require logging in again.

Snowflake supports **multiple languages** using [I18n](https://github.com/AlexanderZaytsev/react-native-i18n) with English, French and Spanish.

Snowflake supports **Hot Reloading** of its state.  

Snowflake uses CI with [Bitrise.io]( https://www.bitrise.io) and has **extensive docs and 45+ min of video** demonstating implementation.
